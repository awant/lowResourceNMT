1) BackTranslation




2) ForwardTranslation. Sennrich et al. (2015)




3) Semi-supervised (from other NMT tasks, e.g. make use of monolingual embeddings)
Problem: Word2Vec works not quite well on subwords
- stemming
- coverage 



4) Transfer learning from other NMT Task
- search for t2t models
- zero-shot translation
